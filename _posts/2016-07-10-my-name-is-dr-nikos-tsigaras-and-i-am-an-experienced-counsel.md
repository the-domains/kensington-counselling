My name is Dr Nikos Tsigaras and I am an experienced Counselling Psychologist offering individual, family, and relationship counselling in Kensington. I endeavour to offer an ethical and confidential service based on cutting edge psychological research and tailored to your individual needs.

There are a number of reasons why people may seek a psychological therapy and the different sections of this website provide information on a range of psychological services.

A major challenge in today's society is work related stress and worries about performance and job security. **Individuals** may also be bothered by a range of distressing thoughts and feelings around self-esteem or experience difficulties in forming and maintaining close relationships. Some people may be interested in personal development and increased self-understanding.

**Parents** may have significant difficulties managing a child, or feel very anxious about whether they are doing a good job. Often such problems create further tension within the couple or place additional burdens to an already exhausted single parent.

Expectant **mothers** may be struggling with aspects of their pregnancy and even dread the times ahead, perhaps because of experiences with previous children.

**Couples** often present to therapy because they feel that their relationship has reached a crisis point. There may have been an affair or affairs, difficulty conceiving, sexual problems, frequent arguments, or feelings of stagnation and hopelessness.

Choosing a psychological therapy can be a daunting task, especially so when highly distressed and in need of urgent help. As a counselling psychologist I am trained to evaluate and use different therapeutic models and can therefore offer the most appropriate service to each client or clients. Arranging an initial consultation with me is an opportunity to think together about this and to help you decide the most appropriate way forward.

I am particularly interested in diversity and welcome individuals, couples, and families regardless of sexual orientation, ethnic origin, or spiritual beliefs.

In addition to my doctoral training, I hold a Masters in occupational psychology which informs me of the effect of work, or lack of it, on well-being. I also hold a Masters in the theory of psychoanalysis which assists me in understanding how early experience and an individual's life history can illuminate the problems he or she is facing in the present.

My interests include:

Increasing well-being at work and in family life   
Low self-esteem   
Perinatal psychology   
States of anxiety and depression that arise in response to working in very demanding professional environments   
Problems in forming and maintaining relationships   
Concerns around gender identity, sexuality, and sexual practices   
Eating disorders and body image difficulties   
Psychosis and unusual experiences   
  
Some other problems I can help with:

Anxiety and depression   
Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia   
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder   
Social Phobia   
Other phobias   
Personality disorders   
Childhood sexual abuse and current sexual, domestic, or other abuse   
Suicidal feelings   
Self-harm  
Alcohol or drug misuse   
Chronic health conditions   
Loss of interest, meaning, or direction, chronic feelings of emptiness, boredom or agitation

I am particularly interested in diversity and welcome individuals, couples, and families regardless of sexual orientation, ethnic origin, or spiritual beliefs.
