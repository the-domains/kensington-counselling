**I am an experienced Chartered Counselling Psychologist offering private counselling and psychotherapy services in Kensington.**

I am registered as a counselling psychologist with the [Health and Care Professions Council][0] (HCPC), the organisation that regulates psychology in the UK. I am also chartered with the [British Psychological Society][1] (BPS), which is the gold standard of practice for British psychologists. I abide by the code of ethics and standards of practice of both organisations. You can locate my registration details by clicking on the above links. I am also DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checked which is necessary to work with children and adolescents.  
I am originally from Greece (and can offer therapy in Greek, as well as English) and completed 8 years of psychology training in in the UK. I have been working in the NHS for a number of years with the full spectrum of needs in primary, secondary and tertiary care settings with both outpatients and inpatients, individuals, groups, and families. In addition to my doctoral training, I hold a number of post graduate qualifications including a masters in the theory of psychoanalysis, and a masters in occupational psychology which assists me in understaning the impact of work, or lack of it, on a person's well-being.

Counselling psychology is one of the applied clinical branches of psychology that draws on evidence gathered from research and practice to explore what it means to be a person and to understand how well-being can be achieved and psychological distress alleviated. Counselling psychologists are trained to use and evaluate different therapeutic models and are commited to working with each person's specific needs. I have been trained in cognitive behavioural (CBT), psychodynamic, and humanistic therapeutic models. You can find out more about counselling psychology [here][2].
